A distributed System is a collection of independent computers that gives a Single System Image.

Distributed System :
                       1) Multiple systems that are autonomous.

                       2) Presents SSI to outside users/world.

                       3) Hence these systems needs to collaborate - Heart of distributed system tech.



  so what we talking about ? - A logical layer (software) which sits on hardware of
                              multiple m/c , network and basic communication.


                              And it tries hard to hide all this and present itself as One big System.
