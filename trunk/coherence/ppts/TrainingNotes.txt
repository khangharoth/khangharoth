Training Structure :
 
 
 A) 2 Hours Onbaording session - what's this is all about
 
         a) What's the problem.
  
         b) Scaling Databases.
 
              Oracle Rac VS Coherence 
                 i)  Clustered and so fault tolerant and Scalable - Both
                ii)  Supports Acid and Sql - Oracle Rac
               iii)  No Disk access - Coherence 
 
        c) Single JVM Caches
 
        d) Distributed Caches.
        
        e) ACID ---> BASE


    Key Concepts at the end of Onboarding Session :

           a) Coherence is Just a big Hash Map : All Data is stored as Key Values pairs.

           b) Coherence resilency : Mulitple machine failure
        
                         You can have muliple copies but then these would be needed to be updated on write - Distributed Locking problem.
        
                         Resilence is sacrifised for speed.
        
        
        
 
 B) Starting with Coherence : 
  
  
         a) Coherence as a Map - Just a basic Get And Put
         
         b) More than one Node cluster
         
         c) How Cluster detects the health of a node
